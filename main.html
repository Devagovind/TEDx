            <div class="thinking-content">With a wave of unknown hitting us every day. last year seemed to be a wholesale stock of it. Unaware of what to expect, we coped with all the consequences as we had hope and directed our inner self to the best. Mental health got its due and
                people started to emote and express themselves and found those deep roots which hold the entire system of their being. All of this was possible as we were out in the wild conscience of greater things and did not have the otherwise hectic,
                loaded life of which became ignored and agreed' slaves. We here, with similar energy, want to start this event and let our abilities to create change, take the lead and make us realize that the fine space between fiction and reality is
                home, it's our happy meme.</div>

            <p class="organiser-p">Coming together for the event has been one of the rewards to itself. We as organisers have not only invested money here for returns but the astonishing correlation of the event with our organisational vision and beliefs made this partnership immeasurably better. The theme for the event being "Solitude Thinking" scrupulously sums up our past two years. With pandemic testing our limits daily, we have never stopped, and have just involved heightening our instincts and thinking. With the same message to spread across and bring more of us under the same banner of humans, we have agreed to organize this exceptional event adding our flavour to it. The line of speakers and their stories of inspiration are worth the platform and we together resolve to make this theme a lifestyle, not all work has profit, but all work has intention, and we are sure, you would be gladdened by ours.</p>
